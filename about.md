Although numerous and very good textbooks on Kalman filtering exist, some only scratch the surface, do not cover the full scope, simplify, omit important aspects of implementation, or do not bridge the gap to practice. 
Because of this, the full potential of the fascinating Kalman filter method is not fully exploited. 
This page seeks to be a supplementary resource for the professional user.
In particular, a collection of practical examples and knowledge beyond textbooks for students will be published here.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact the author.
