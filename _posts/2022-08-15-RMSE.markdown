With the help of the error of the state estimation \\( \tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k) = \mathbf{x}(k) - \mathbf{x}(k) \\), the root of the mean square error can be calculated. 
The RMSE is a quality measure for the absolute estimation error. 
It is determined in a simulation of length K. The RMSE is then calculated for each time \\( k \in {1...K} \\), averaged by N Monte Carlo runs:

\\[ \text{RMSE}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k)) =  \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} (\tilde{x}^i_1(k)^2 + ... + \tilde{x}^i_n(k)^2)} \\]

where \\( n = \text{dim}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k)) \\)  is.
The RMSE should always be calculated only for elements of a certain kind, because it is not correct to add for example velocity and acceleration. 
If for example a velocity is chosen as state vector, then one speaks of the RMSE of the velocity. 
The smaller the RMSE, the better is state estimator or fusion algorithm.

If real measurement data are to be evaluated, the RMSE can only be calculated from a single run. 
The RMSE thus has no statistical significance. 
The RMSE can therefore alternatively be calculated via the mean estimation error:

\\[ \mu_{\tilde{x}} = \frac{1}{K} \sum^K_{k=1}  \tilde{\mathbf{x}} \\]

and the standard deviation of the estimation error:

\\[ \sigma_{\tilde{x}} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{K} \sum^K_{k=1} (\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k) - \mu_{\tilde{x}}  )^2 } \\]

with 

\\[ \text{RMSE}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k)) = \sqrt{ \mu_{\tilde{x}}  + \sigma_{\tilde{x}} }  \. \\]

However, since the true state x must be known, this can only be done in practice can only be done with highly accurate reference data.
