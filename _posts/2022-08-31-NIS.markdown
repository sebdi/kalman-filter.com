The NIS hypothesis test allows to check whether the Kalman filter is consistent with the measurement residual and the associated innovation covariance matrix.

*The NIS hypothesis test uses the same mechanics as the [NEES hypothesis test](/normalized-estimation-error-squared/). It is therefore recommended to read this article first.*

Measurement prediction \\( \mathbf{\hat{z}}(k)  \\)
Measurement residual
\\[ \nu (k) = \mathbf{z}(k) - \mathbf{\hat{z}}(k)\\\]

\\[ \epsilon_\nu (k) = \nu(k)^T \mathbf{S}(k)^{-1} \nu(k) \ .\\]

As with [NEES](/normalized-estimation-error-squared/), the quantity \\( \epsilon_\nu (k) \\) is chi-squared distributed with \\( \text{dim}( \nu(k) ) = n_z \\) degrees of freedom, i.e. the dimension of the measurement vector \\( \hat{z}(k)  \\).


\\[ \text{NIS}( \epsilon\_{\nu}(k) ) = \overline{\epsilon}\_{\nu} (k)  = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} \epsilon^i_\nu(k) \. \\]


\\( \overline{\epsilon}\\) has the property that the mean converges towards \\( N n_x \\) and that \\( \overline{\epsilon}\\) is chi-squared distributed with \\( N n_x \\) degrees of freedom.
The consistency test is done with a hypothesis test. 
Under the hypothesis \\( H_0 \\) that the filter is consistent, the hypothesis \\( H_0 \\) is accepted if

\\[ \overline{\epsilon} (k) \in [r_1,r_2] \. \\]

The acceptance interval is chosen such that the probability that \\( H_0 \\) is accepted is \\( (1 - \alpha) \\)

\\[ P \\{ \overline{\epsilon} (k) \in [r_1,r_2]  \| H_0 \\} = 1 - \alpha \. \\]
