With the help of the error of the state estimation \\( \tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k) = \mathbf{x}(k) - \mathbf{\hat{x}}(k) \\), the root of the mean square error can be calculated. 
The RMSE is a quality measure for the absolute estimation error. 
It is determined in a simulation of length K. The RMSE is then calculated for each time \\( k \in {1...K} \\), averaged by N Monte Carlo runs

\\[ \text{RMSE}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k)) =  \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} (\tilde{x}^i_1(k)^2 + ... + \tilde{x}^i_n(k)^2)} \\]

where \\( n = \text{dim}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k)) \\)  is.
The RMSE should always be calculated only for elements with the same unit, because it is not correct to add e.g. velocity and acceleration.
In this case, RMSE's are determined per state or unit.
If for example a velocity is chosen as a state vector, it is called the RMSE of the velocity.
In general, the smaller the RMSE, the better a state estimate.

If real measurement data are to be evaluated, the RMSE can only be calculated from a single run. 
The RMSE thus has no statistical significance. 
The RMSE can therefore alternatively be calculated via the mean estimation error

\\[ \mu_{\tilde{x}} = \frac{1}{K} \sum^K_{k=1}  \tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k) \\]

and the standard deviation of the estimation error

\\[ \sigma_{\tilde{x}} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{K} \sum^K_{k=1} (\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k) - \mu_{\tilde{x}}  )^2 } \\]

with 

\\[ \text{RMSE}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(k)) = \sqrt{ \mu_{\tilde{x}}  + \sigma_{\tilde{x}} }  \. \\]

However, since the true state \\( \mathbf{x} \\), i.e. a "ground truth", must be available, this can only be done in practice with highly accurate reference data.
It may also be the case that not all states can be measured by reference measuring devices. 
It is therefore legitimate to calculate the RMSE only for the states for which reference data are available.
